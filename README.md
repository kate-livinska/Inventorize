This app helps to streamline inventory at a storage facility.


<h3>${\color{lightgreen}Functionality}$</h3>
<p>The app obtains a list of orders from the server. When an order is selected by the user, a new window opens with the scan area and a list of items in the order.</p>
<p>When an item is scanned, the app matches its EAN with the items in the list and displays the box number where the item should be placed. The popup with the box number also has an option to change item quantity if it differs from the data obtained from the server.</p>
<p>If there is no information on item quantity obtained from the server, before showing the popup with the box number, the app opens a new window where the user can enter the item quantity.</p>
<p>If no item is found by EAN, the app invites the user to search for the item by SKU. While the user is typing the SKU, matching autocomplete suggestions from the items list are shown.</p>
<p>When the user taps the popup with the box number, it disappears and the scan view is shown again with the list of items in the order.</p>
<p>At any time the user can save inventory data to the server by pressing the corresponding button.</p>
